NEVER CHANGE THE NAME OF ANY FILES OR FOLDERS, IT MAY RENDER
THE SCRIPT UNUSABLE!

Config files are located in the 'config' folder.

This script relies on the luafilesystem library. Precompiled DLLs for
the Windows version are included. Under Linux/BSD you will have to install
the luafilesystem library -- either via your package manager or via LuaRocks.
You will find this out, since it is not harder to install PtokaX on these
platforms. ;-)
